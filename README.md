# BasicCRUDProject
A basic implementation of "CRUD" functionality using Java into a json file.

# Instructions
1. Download the latest release from the releases tab and extract it into a folder. run.bat and BasicCRUD.jar should be in the same directory.
2. With Java installed, double click run.bat to run BasicCRUD.jar.
3. Commands are displayed in the command window. You are given the ability to create new entries, edit, delete, view, save, exit, and clear all entries.
4. After typing "save" or "s" as a command, your data will be saved into a dataFile.json file that's put alongside run.bat and BasicCRUD.jar.

# Notes
- This has been tested in a Windows environment and requires Windows to run the .bat file. This should be compatible with other OSes if you run the .jar file through the command prompt equivalent.

- Java needs to be installed to run the .jar file.

- The .json will be in its standard messy format while saved onto your computer. The "view" command will make it more readable in the command prompt.

- The "create" command can also be used to edit entries. If you input an Entry Name and Attribute Name that overlaps with another existing entry, that entry will be edited. 

- Entry Names are used to group attributes under them. This allows you to make collections of items to refer to later.
